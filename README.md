A simple React app that I completed as a technical challenge for a job interview. The app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and then presents the five day forcast for a given city.

To run app, first you need to have node installed. Once you have node installed, run `npm install` to install package dependencies. Then run `npm run start` and open your browser at localhost:8080.
